# DFP-Dataset
This dataset is used in the paper Multi-Target Device-Free Positioning Based on Spatial-Temporal mmWave Point Cloud.
Following, we introduce the composition of this dataset.

# Data:
1. Multi-target positioning raw data in indoor and outdoor scenarios.
   Frequency Slope(MHz/us)=62, Sample Rate(ksps)=5000, No of Frame=180.

2. Multi-target positioning raw data in NLOS scenarios.
   Frequency Slope(MHz/us)=58, Sample Rate(ksps)=6200, No of Frame=40.

4. Small fan experiments raw data for evaluating measurement precision and resolution.
   Frequency Slope(MHz/us)=58, Sample Rate(ksps)=6200, No of Frame=90.
